KCX Qwerty - Keyboard-Centric Experience 
========================================

QWERTY variant for a keyboard-centric and mouseless desktop experience.

- Streamlines keyboard shortcut usage with laptops, touch typists, 
vim users, and terminal hobbits in mind.
- Emulate vim motions ***everywhere***
- Additional layouts are provided to take advantage of keyboard layout switching.

Quickstart
----------
### Installation
```
git clone --no-checkout --depth=1 --filter=tree:0 https://github.com/jnzigg/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
git sparse-checkout set --no-cone .config/xkb
git checkout
mkdir --parents $HOME/.config/xkb/rules
mkdir --parents $HOME/.config/xkb/symbols
cp --recursive --suffix=.bak .config/xkb/rules/* $HOME/.config/xkb/rules/
cp --recursive --suffix=.bak .config/xkb/symbols/* $HOME/.config/xkb/symbols/
```
> [!NOTE]
> This will overwrite existing destination files. Your original files such as *evdev.xml*
will be saved as *evdev.xml.bak*

### Sway
```
set $kb "1:1:AT_Translated_Set_2_keyboard"
input $kb {
    xkb_layout kcx(qwerty),kcx(homerow_sym)
}
```

```
bindsym Control+semicolon exec swaymsg input $kb xkb_switch_layout next
```

You can use my [bash script][sway-kbfb] if you want to change focused window border colors when switching layouts.

```
set $lay1_n "KCX (Qwerty)"
set $lay1_c "$green $green $green $white $green"
set $lay2_n "KCX (Homerow Symbols)"
set $lay2_c "$red $red $red $white $red"
bindsym Control+semicolon exec sway-kbfb $kb $lay1_n $lay1_c $lay2_n $lay2_c
```



### GNOME

1. Search for *KCX (Qwerty)* and *KCX (Homerow Symbols)* in `gnome-control-center > Keyboard > Input Sources`
2. Set the layout switch shortcut under `...Keyboard > View and Customize Shortcuts > Typing`
with my recommended *Control + semicolon* keybind.
3. Instead of using the full layout, you can toggle individual options in
`gnome-tweaks > Keyboard & Mouse > Additional Layout Options > KCX Options`

FAQ
---

### Why QWERTY instead of this other superior layout?

Qwerty is the standard. Learning an obscure layout for speed/ergonomics is unnecessary and inconvenient. 
On average, I type 110-135wpm which is more than enough (i flexed on ya btw). My style of touch typing
also maximizes ergonomics. *(I'll probably make a repo/wiki on this)*

### Where's Right Shift?

I never used it so it went bye-bye.

### Where's Right Alt? I need AltGr for foreign characters.

I do not use it so it was replaced with Escape. I suggest replacing Right Control with Right Alt instead
of Caps Lock in QWERTY mode if it is essential.

### Do I need a special keyboard for this?

Any standard keyboard will do. Flatter keyboards on laptops are better solely because it is easier
to press the relocated Escape with the right thumb. I find that bulky spacebars often get in the way.

### Copy Pasting in shell is buggy when using Homerow Symbols.

You might be doing `Control+RelocatedShift+{something}`. Instead, do 
`RelocatedShift+Control+{something}`. `Control+OriginalShift` and `OriginalShift+Control`
should both work properly still.
>
In KCX (Homerow Symbols), S is replaced with *[ Shift_L ]*. Despite this, 
`Control+RelocatedShift` becomes `Control+S` which sends a XOFF signal, freezing
the shell. `Control+q` will send XON and unfreeze the shell. There's probably a
way to configure this properly to prevent such behavior but eh...
>
In the meantime, XOFF/XON can be disabled  entirely by adding `stty -ixon` to 
`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. To unfreeze the shell using any key, add `stty ixany` 
instead. [(source)][xoff/xon]

### Can I use a different base layout? (e.g. Dvorak, Colemak)

Yes. The remaps target key codes (keyboard location), not the represented 
symbols. The base layout can be changed inside `$HOME/.config/xkb/symbols/kcx`:
```
include "us(basic)" // replace this
include "us(dvorak)" // with this
```

> [!NOTE]
> layout, variant, and option labels are hardcoded so they won't
automatically reflect the actual symbols they are remapping. In Dvorak,
`kcxvar/homerow_sym(d_becomes_delete)` turns your `E` into `Delete`.

### Does this apply to TTY as well?
No. And I don't recommend doing anything this complicated to your TTY
settings... ***here be dragons***
