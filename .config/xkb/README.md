KCX Qwerty - Keyboard-Centric Experience 
========================================

QWERTY variant for a keyboard-centric and mouseless desktop experience.

KCX Qwerty is a variant made with touch typists, vim users, and terminal
hobbits in mind. It retains the placement of alphanumeric keys and relocates modifier
keys and super keys with sane defaults. Additional layouts are included to take
advantage of keyboard layout switching.
